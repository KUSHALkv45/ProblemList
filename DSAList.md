-[prefix Sum trick] - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/count-of-subarrays-with-average-k/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) 
- here we want a subarray with k average , if we found a subarray with k average
- if we subtract k from all elements then the sum of elements become zero so we tranform array to arr[i] - k
- then The problem becomes finding same sum subarrays
- Intresting model
